Suppose we measure $p$ things about $n$ individuals and represent this dataset as an $n \times p$ matrix $X$ n個個體的p事件

if we regress the final p-th observation, against the others using a linear model written as 線性模型對最後的第p個觀測值進行回歸
$$
X_{ip} = \beta_0 + \sum_{j=1}^{p-1} \beta_j X_{ij} + \varepsilon_i
$$
where the $εi$ are noise terms with $E[εi] = 0$
這種情況下，我們將減少n-p所需的信息量
